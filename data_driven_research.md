# Data-Driven Research

- [The Art of Data Science (Roger D. Peng and Elizabeth Matsui)](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/artofdatascience/):
  What we have set out to do in this book is to write down the process of data
  analysis. What we describe is not a specific “formula” for data
  analysis—something like “apply this method and then run that test”— but rather
  is a general process that can be applied in a variety of situations.
