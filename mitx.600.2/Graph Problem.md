# Resource List: Graphs, DFS, BFS, Stack & Queue

---

## Resources for Understanding Graphs, DFS, BFS, Stack & Queue  
*Based on Lecture 3 of the course — selected for diverse backgrounds and learning styles.*

---

## Topics Covered from Lecture 3
- What is a Graph? (nodes, edges, directed vs. undirected, weighted vs. unweighted)
- Graph Representations (adjacency list and matrix)
- Python implementation of Node, Edge, Digraph, and Graph classes
- DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Stacks and Queues
- Finding the shortest path (unweighted and weighted)
