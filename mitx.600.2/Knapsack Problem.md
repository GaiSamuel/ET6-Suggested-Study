# Knapsack Problem â€“

## What is the Knapsack Problem?

The **0/1 Knapsack Problem** is a classic computational problem where you're given a set of items, each with a value and a weight. The goal is to choose a combination of items such that:

- The **total weight does not exceed** a specified limit, and  
- The **total value is as high as possible**.
